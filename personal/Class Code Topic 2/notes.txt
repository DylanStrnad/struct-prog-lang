* environment - stores values of identifiers (e.g. x: 3)

* constraints - variable only stores specific type (int, char, etc)

* Implement assignment statement: <identifier> "=" <expression>
    * "1" can be an expression( expression can be a factor)
    * side effect - statement modifies the environment
    
Statement = print statement | assignment statement

* \b - boundary character
* \W - word character
