*Operator helps identify the operands

AST evaluation:
1. identify Operator
2. decide on operands
3. evaluate inital operands
4. execute Operator by *IMPORTANT* Lazy-evaluation(Do not evaluate unless needed) if needed

ex.
 +
/ \
3  4

Recursive Success conditions: 
1. needs exit condition(stops recursion) 
2. recursive problem is smaller than previous problem
